# BallsOnline

###The #1 Massively Multiplayer Online Ball-related game of Q2 2015

####Current Issues:
- Clients leaving under certain conditions will not remove ball from other clients screen - not sure the reason
- Clients will sometimes remove the wrong ball on another clients disconnect - not sure the reason


####To Do:
- Class architecture and flow need to be ironed out
- Persistence model needs a bit of an overhaul
- Integrate with Physijs (http://chandlerprall.github.io/Physijs/)
  - Collision detection (Physijs)
  - Gravity (Physijs)
  - Friction (Physijs)
- Create large terrain to navigate
- Usernames - move away from guid as much as possible (?)
- ~~Implement TypeScript version for modularity~~
